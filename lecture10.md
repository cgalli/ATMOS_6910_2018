# Functions and code design

**There is no one right way to deisgn software and write code.** And because there is rarely one right way to solve a problem or task, the design of programs take many shapes. The language used to dvelop in will often influence the style used in programming.

When we refer to desciptors like "good" and "bad" ways of writing code, what we often mean is how efficient, or simple, or readable the code is.

There are plenty of books, blogs, evangelists, tweeters, and more who proclaim The proper way to design software. All of them are right, and all of them are wrong.

In the continuum of code styles and techniques, a few stand out, mostly because they are en vogue at the moment (and some just make good practical sense).
