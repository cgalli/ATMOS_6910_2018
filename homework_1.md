As a primer for this class, we're going to walk through solving a very simple problem in an overly verbose fashion! Consider the following problem to solve, taken from [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) :

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```
How would you approach solving this problem? Can you think of more than one practical way to solve this? 

Here's how I would think through this process (in free form):

- I know I need to start with two values: 1 and 2.
- I need to remember/hold the current Fibonacci number, from the previous two.
- I'm probably going to iterate/loop N number of times in order to find the result.
- I don't care about remembering any more than the last two Fibonacci numbers.
- I can take the modulus of 2 of my current number to know it it's even or odd.
- I need a "total" variable to store the sum of all even matching values.

I might also be asking myself things that were not expressly part of the original task:
- Maybe I should keep track of all numbers that match anyway...
- Maybe I should count the number of times I iterated in a loop, because that's kind of interesting...
- ... and ?

I might then start to write some psuedo code, but expressed as simple "task-like" statements:

(This might be written in the python file before I even start writing the code--it's a place to start for me).
```
assign a list or array with the first two numbers of 1 and 2
assign a variable to store the totals

start loop with the condition that the last Fibonacci number in the sequence is less than 4 million
  in loop, add last two numbers to get current
  if current number is gt (>) 4,000,000, break
  else
    check if number is even or odd (take the modulus %)
    if even, add it to "totals" variable
    else, just keep looping
  
  continue looping
print out the total

```

## Your Homework
Write the code in the language of your choice that solves the above problem. Add a few lines of comments that explain what you're doing in the code.
