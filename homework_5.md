## The assignment
Plot a GOES-16 scene for a part or all of CONUS (continental U.S.). You can use or borrow or copy any code that plots a GOES-16 scene for any channel. If you borrow code (copy) from Brian Blaylock's github repo examples, make at least one change to the code to make it your own. This could be anything from changing the color scheme, to selecting a different regional subset, or even plotting it in a different projection.

Simple, right?

The goals of this homework is to gain preliminary exposure to this valuable resource for use in the final project.
