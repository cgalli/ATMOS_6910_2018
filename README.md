## Course Description
Environmental scientists need the ability to acquire, process and display environmental data, imagery, and gridded fields.  This course is designed to develop the skills necessary to solve physically-based problems relating to atmospheric science data sets. After a review of basic programming concepts, students will develop code to solve problems using programming languages and data sources relevant to their ongoing or future research.  The course is particularly relevant for first-year graduate students as they begin research leading towards their thesis proposal.  

It is assumed students have exposure and practical experience working with a common programming language used within physical sciences, such as Python, MatLab, or IDL. There is no requirement for using one language over another. However, it is important the student is comfortable working in a language that has available module/API bindings to common data libraries; specifically, NetCDF4, HDF, and CSV parsing.

## Course Outcomes 
By the end of this course, you will be able to: 
- Write computer programs for analyzing data.
- Acquire and use data in multiple file formats. 
- Create custom ways to display data.
